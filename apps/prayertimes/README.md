# Prayer Times (Adhan)

This app provides muslim prayer times, based on the awesome [adhan.js](https://github.com/batoulapps/adhan-js) library.

Unfortunately, I am not sure if the library still works as expected, because I had to adapt the code to work with espruino.

## Usage

Just start the app and it shows you the next prayer times of the day.

## Future functionality...

* Enable selecting location
* Enable choosing calculation method
* Adhan notification
* ...
