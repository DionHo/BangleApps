# Prayer Times (Adhan)

This app provides muslim prayer times, based on the awesome [adhan.js](https://github.com/batoulapps/adhan-js) library. (Unfortunately, I am not sure if the library still works as expected, because I had to adapt the code to work with espruino.)

You can configure your location and the prayer time calculation method, and also enable adhan.

## Usage

Just start the app and it shows you the next prayer times of the day.
On the end of the list, you can switch to settings, where you can
 * set your location based on gps,
 * configure the prayer times calculation method and
 * activate adhan
